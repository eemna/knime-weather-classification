# Weather Classification with KNIME üå¶Ô∏è

This project predicts "RainTomorrow" using several supervised learning algorithms in KNIME:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Logistic Regression
- SVM

## Steps
1. Data preparation (filtering, missing values, normalization, partitioning)
2. Model training and prediction
3. Evaluation with Scorer and ROC Curve nodes

## Tools
- KNIME Analytics Platform
- Machine Learning algorithms

## Goal
Compare model performances and determine the most accurate classifier for predicting rainfall.
